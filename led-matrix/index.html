                        <p>
                            My inspiration for this project came not from ultra-HD screens, but from the old-fashioned mechanical displays 
                            that once showed train and bus schedules. Other makers have created beautiful looking - and sounding - mechanical displays, 
                            like <span><a href="https://hackaday.io/project/159415-flip-dot-display-diy-controller/log/152569-daisy-chained">these flip-dots</a></span> 
                            (I recommend reading the whole blog for a fun project story). I wanted to replicate this so badly, but I was deterred by the cost of flip-dots.
                            Instead, I thought I might enjoy a similarly retro feel, for a fraction of the price, with a low-resolution LED pixel display. 
                            I did some research into LED control, learned about WS2812b and individually-addressable LEDs, and bought a few cheap 16x16 grids to start experimenting with.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With those LEDs and a spare Arduino Uno, I was able to get started. 
                            I breadboarded out the electrical connections between the Arduino microcontroller and 4 grids, making a 32x32 display.
                            After a good bit of debugging, I could print text and draw simple shapes.
                            However, the Arduino was already running out of memory space by holding the red, green, and blue colors for each of 1,024 LEDs,
                            limiting the fun software I could program into the controller. 
                            Also, I envisioned the final product being controllabe from a webpage or web app, which would be a little difficult with an Arduino Uno.
                            I made the decision to change microcontrollers, first playing with an Arduino Mega (more memory, but no built-in WiFi), and then settling on an ESP-32. 
                            This microcontroller gave me a lot more memory to work with (a whole 8MB of flash, wow!!) and out-of-the-box Wi-Fi connectivity. Much easier!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With a better computer, my visions for the product grew. Instead of just text, I could do some image processing. 
                            This led to the Image Display mode with uploaded and hand-drawn images.
                            The computer could handle some simple physics simulations, so before long it had both a simulated fireplace and a (non-physical) plasma wave display.
                            It could connect to API endpoints over the web easily, and I reluctantly made the product slightly functional: it can tell you the time and the next DC metro train. 
                            This computer could even compute some hefty discrete Fourier Transforms, so I bought a cheap microphone to create the classic bass-bumping music visualization.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The full list of parts I bought for this build are on Github, as are the custom 3D-printed pieces of the frame. 
                            The frame is sized to surround the 32x32 LED grid tightly, with extra space on the bottom to house other components, 
                            like the power supply connector, microphone, and mode control push button. 
                            It is also a thick frame to cover the ESP-32 mounted behind the LEDs. 
                            Because of the size of the grid, the frame was too big to 3D-print at once, and had to be assembled with lots of screws.
                            In front of the LEDs is a sheet of diffusive black acrylic, protecting the delicate parts and spreading the light out. 
                            This acryllic only came in sheets smaller than the display needed, so extra had to be glued onto the edges, leaving an unsightly seam.
                            Besides that, it looks passably sleek with the black PLA frame and flush components.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On top of its handling of signals to each LED, the ESP-32 microcontroller runs a web server on my local network. 
                            It serves static webpages to local devices which can be used to change the LED display modes and set details of each display mode, like
                            the text color or image source. 
                            The QR code on the front of the frame takes users right to the main control page, so using the display is a breeze!
                            The web server process was new for me, and learning the web stack was very different from my clunky C++ controlling the ESP-32's internal logic.
                            I compensated by writing equally clunky Javascript, and including the bare minimum CSS to make my User Interface designer friends wince every time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are many things I would change if I started over, and many things I can change in software at any time. I've tried to capture them 
                            all in my Github documentation. Many of them are lessons learned on the mechanical design - better wire management, better mounts for the 
                            microphone and push button and ESP-32, etc. 
                            Others are related to the web server: my UI is very lacking, for one, and I'd also love for it to update live, so you can play Pong or PacMan.
                            I do hope I get to them someday.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Overall, this project is a clunky and immediately-obsolete art piece that I am quite proud of. 
                            It was never meant to be useful - we are surrounded by much more useful electronic displays at all times anyway.
                            But it is very fun, in a nostalgic 8-bit way, to put up a grossly-pixelated selfie of your friend in the living room, 
                            or leave a message for a loved one, and see every dot of electricity working together to make it look just okay.
