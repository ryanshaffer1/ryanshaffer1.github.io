                Welcome to my Maker Portfolio! 
                Whether you're visiting as a friend, a maker looking for inspiration (of which I can provide little), or as a critic of my engineering prowess, enjoy your look around. 
                I'm new to this hobby, and taking every step as a learning process rather than a finished product. 
                I am an engineer by trade, but I tailor these projects to expose me to new domains, so I'm usually starting from the ground floor. 
                
                Let me know how you think I can learn more!
            </p>
            <p>
                These projects are all fully personal, with no professional contributions or obligations. Everything is open-source!
            </p>
